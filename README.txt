Notes:

-code for our general simulations (i.e., not specific to Vulpia) can be found in "code for ms - main simulations - all figs"

-code specific to the Vulpia analyses can be found in "vulpia fitting"

-"summary of simulatiomn" contains the summary outputs from a run of the "vulpia fitting" code

-note that regenerating plots or summary statistics using either script leads to minor deviances in outcomes, owning to the stochastic nature of our environmental sampling

-figures presented in the manuscript were based on figures generated using this code, finished in Affinity Designer to combine plots as panels and enhance the aesthetics

-there were too many plots for GitHub to house, but all can be recreated by re-running the code
